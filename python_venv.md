Use and advantage of the `venv` modul

Start using the `venv` modul in order to work in a virtual environment.

The idea is, to have for each git project your own python environment and
to separate the used libraries as well as not mixing dependencies.

Keep in mind to add the folder of your environment to your gitignore file and keep your git repository clean.
