# How to contribute

This is a guide on how to contribute to projects on GitHub.

## Contribution procedure
### 1. Issue

Issues are individual problems within a project that need to be fixed. You can either **create a new issue**, in case you spot a problem or work on an already **existing issue**.
Open issues can be accessible for anyone to work on or optionally be assigned to a single contributor.

### 2. Fork the repository

After selecting an issue to work on, fork the repository in order to work on the issue without immediately affecting the original version.
There are two ways to fork the repository. You can either use **GitHub Desktop**, which is offers a visual interface and is therefore better suited for beginners, or alternatively use the **git command line interface**.

### 3. Create a working branch

Within the forked repository create a new branch, which will be used to make changes and later commit your work to the original repository.

### 4. Commit your changes

Once you solved the issue and verified that contribution guidelines of the original project are met, you can commit your changes into your working branch. 

### 5. Pull request

After your changes on the issue are finished, create a PR ([Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)). 
In the PR make sure to link the respective issue and send the request to a contributor of the original repository with sufficient permission to accept your PR. After your PR is review you might be required to make additional changes in order for your changes to be applied. Once your changes meet the requirements of the project, they will be merged into the original repository.

### Your changes have to now been contributed to the project!
